# OSINT-Redirection
Have you ever wanted to search a link or IP address on multiple OSINT pages at once? I have :slightly_smiling_face: , so I created a simple HTML page that I use every day, and I hope it will be useful to you too. If you have any favorite sites that you use, let me know and I will add them. To search, simply add the URL and click the ADD button, then click on the desired buttons to redirect. Note that the "OTHERS" section does not provide a redirection since some pages like Intezer do not use a traditional search query.
